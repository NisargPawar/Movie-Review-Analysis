    " - Store the data in a comma separated file and in SQLite database\n",
    " - Compare the review style across the 3 websites by calculating the cosine similarity score between the keywords used in the reviews of these 3 websites.\n",
    " - Compare the top 50 movies that are considered top rated across the 3 websites by calculating the cosine similarity score between the genres of movies."

    "      - Remove special characters and extra spaces\n",
    "      - Lowercase all text\n",
    "      - create a wordlist and a vocabulary from the movie reviews\n",
    "      - Remove the stop words\n",
    "\n",
    " - Step 4: Use word dictionary to find the top 50 used words on each site, merge this list and create a unique list of words to be the word_attributes.\n",
    " - Step 5: Use this word_attributes list to create movie review vectors for each movie. and calculate cosine similarity between each website (Task 1 complete!)\n",
    " - Step 6: Create a dictionary from the genre details of each movie for each website\n",
    " - Step 7: create a list of unique genres and use this list to create genre vectors for each movie\n",

       "'I\\'ve watched this film around when it came out but decided to rewatch it again recently just because of the new Spider-Man: Miles Morales game. The premise of the movie is simply \"Bitten by a radioactive spider in the subway, Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales suddenly develops mysterious powers that transform him into the one and only Spider-Man. When he meets Peter Parker, he soon realizes that many others share his special, high-flying talents. Miles must now use his newfound skills to battle the evil Kingpin, a hulking madman who can open portals to other universes and pull different versions of Spider-Man into our world\". I absolutely adored it when it came out but do I still feel that way after rewatching it?\\n\\nFirstly, the animation style and 3D models are absolutely amazing! While I do love the Pixar style of animation, this comic book style of animation was such a breath of fresh air in the animated film department. I also appreciate a lot of the aesthetic choices such as having this shaky movement instead of fluid which further makes it feel like a comic book come to life. The action scenes are also animated really well and are an absolute blast to watch as well. Clearly, a lot of thought went into this and it clearly shows in the movie. \\n\\nMiles Morales (Shameik Moore) is a great main lead. He isn\\'t perfect and is actually very flawed with them making a fair amount of what would be frustrating mistakes. However, the directors succeed in still making us root for him as we can see how much he really wants to pull through for the team. Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson) is another great Spiderman in this movie who is a mentor figure for Miles. He is a person who has been doing this spiderman business for over 20 years and has a lot of problems with his Peter Parker life such as his divorce with Mary Jane. Due to this, he is quite neglectful of Miles but he goes through his own character arc that is done very well. His chemistry with Miles is one of the things that really shine in this movie. Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld) is the third Spider character that appears in the movie and is mostly there to be the competent and supportive one in the group for Miles. The other three Spider characters Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage),  Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn) and Peter Porker (John Mulaney) are also all very distinct and different in personality which is perfectly converted despite small screentime. \\n\\nThe cast is also phenomenal, everyone does a great job, especially Shameik Moore and Jake Johnson. There is also some other stellar casting like Brian Tyree Henry as Mile\\'s dad, Mahershala Ali as Mile\\'s Uncle Aaron, Chris Pine as Peter Parker of Mile\\'s universe, Zoë Kravitz as Mary Jane, Kathryn Hahn as Doc Octopus, Liev Schreiber as Kingpin and even Oscar Issac for a mysterious role that I won\\'t spoil. It\\'s an all-star cast and even though some have small roles, Sony still went through with casting big known actors. They all do a great job. The excellent soundtrack further elevates this movie. Every time the Prowler is in the movie there is this horn in the soundtrack that makes him seem more threatening. Additionally, there are some pop, R&B, rap songs within the movie that all fit really well and gives more identity to the movie and characters. \\n\\nThe story is simple yet intriguing enough to keep the audience engaged. It introduced the complex multiverse idea but doesn\\'t overcomplicate it to make it distracting. There are multiple villains but the director makes sure the main focus of villains is Kingpin which is a good idea as multiple focus villains will make the plot feel convoluted. There is also excellent dialogue which is thanks to Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman. The jokes all land and the serious moments are heart-warming and the banter enjoyable. It\\'s good dialogue and none feel wasted. \\n\\nIf I have to give the movie a flaw then I would say it is kind of the Spiderman group dynamic. Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker and Peter Porker don\\'t interact much with Miles apart from being extremely harsh on him. It makes the last moments with these Spider characters not as strong. Miles also just become an extremely adept Spiderman because the plot needs him to be. It doesn\\'t completely feel justified since it doesn\\'t feel like he was provided with enough training to be that good. However, it doesn\\'t break the movie and the sacrifices are understandable to keep this origin story in just under 2 hours.\\n\\nOverall, Spider-Man into the Spider-verse is still one of the best-animated movies to come out in a long time. I still loved it after rewatching it. It\\'s a fresh take on Spider-Man that we haven\\'t seen before in a movie. If you haven\\'t watched this movie yet then you must absolutely watch this movie. I can\\'t wait for the sequel!'"
